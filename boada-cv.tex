\section{Professional \newline Experience}
\textbf{Insight Data Science}, New York, New York USA \newline
\textit{Fellow} \hfill \textbf{January, 2020 - Present}\newline
    \begin{list2}
    	\vspace*{-5mm}
    	\item Addressed a shortage of NYC health inspectors which caused critical health violations to remain unaddressed for extended periods of time potentially harming the general public.
    	\item Trained a transparent model to prioritize NYC restaurants based on environmental variables and their past inspection histories.
    	\item Resulted in a XX\% improved performance of NYC inspectors, leading to critical violations being discovered XX days earlier than previously expected..
    \end{list2}

\textbf{Dept. of Physics and Astronomy, Rutgers University}, New Brunswick, New Jersey USA \newline
\textit{Postdoctoral Research Associate} \hfill \textbf{September, 2016 - 2020}\newline
    \begin{list2}
    	\vspace*{-5mm}
    	\item Designed and built parallelized pipelines to process and analyze TBs of astronomical imaging; producing calibrated, standardized data catalogs and rigorous results leading to 2 peer reviewed publications and several hundred hours of telescope time.
    	\item Project managed and coordinated a team of 4, including both senior scientists and graduate students,
      to perform quality control tasks; deliver science products; and produce peer-reviewed publications.
    	\item Contributed to widely used (in astronomy), open source, Python projects through bug fixes and feature additions: see \href{https://github.com/boada/photometrypipeline}{\sc{photometrypipeline}}, \href{http://astlib.sourceforge.net/}{\sc{astLib}}, and \href{https://github.com/boada/easyGalaxy}{\sc{easyGalaxy}} on Github as examples.

\textbf{Texas A\&M University}, College Station, Texas USA\newline
\textit{Ph.D Candidate} \hfill \textbf{August, 2010 - 2016}\newline
    \begin{list2}
    	\vspace*{-5mm}
      \item Demonstrated that traditional statistical methods could be improved by up to a factor of 3, when combined with machine learning, specifically for a (then planned) large observation campaign.
      \item Implemented these machine learning methods and produced improved results in a pilot survey of the real sky and under real-world conditions.
    	\item Collaborated with group members both in person, and through collaborative tools (e.g., GitHub, SVN).
    	\item Presented scientific results in high-impact, peer reviewed journals and at international conferences.

% \textit{Master's Candidate} \hfill \textbf{August, 2007 - 2009}\newline
%     \begin{list2}
%     	\vspace*{-5mm}
%       \item Implemented a C-based pipeline to process hundreds of GBs of simulation results. Including a computer vision algorithm to automatically analyze and compare results to expected targets.
%       \item Optimized simulation parameters using a genetic algorithm based search utilizing HPC (100k+ core) systems at the National Center for Computational Science, part of Oak Ridge National Laboratory
